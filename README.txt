A minimax algorithm was implemented with a basic heuristic function. No advanced features were used. In order to keep it under time the depth was set to 3 permanently. The heuristic function just weighed the positions differently, with heigher weight given to cornders and edges.

To get ready for the tournament specifically the heuristic was altered somewhat to go for corners more as the ai was losing two many games by giving up the corners.
